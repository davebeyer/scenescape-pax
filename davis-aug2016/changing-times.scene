    <title> 
      Last regressive push from a dying breed
      used to being in power
    </title>

    <description>
      Weintana, from Poughkeepsie, NY, was back visiting family in
      Davis, California, where we met her in August, 2016.  In the
      coming years, she'd like to see "actual" gun control,
      education reform to return the focus to teaching how to
      learn and think, and more in the media asking critical
      questions and promoting real conversation rather than trying to
      yell the loudest.
