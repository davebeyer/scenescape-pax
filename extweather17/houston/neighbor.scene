Flooding 160 thousand homes could mean 1.6 million new doors
    </title>

    <description>
Kathleen spoke about the impossible, myriad of decisions that must be
made in the hours or minutes you have to prepare for a flood, as well
as the overwhelming logistics in recovering from it.  For instance,
"When you have 160,000 flooded homes in the same county at the same
time, and if everybody needs 10 new doors, that's 1.6 million
replacement doors."
