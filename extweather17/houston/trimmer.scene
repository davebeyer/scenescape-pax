We met Tonie in the front yard of her home in the Nottingham Forest
neighborhood of Houston, Texas.  On the morning before the major flood
hit their neighborhood, a number of her neighbors came over to enjoy a
pancake breakfast and discuss what they were going to do.  One by one,
as they watched the waters rise during the day, they decided they'd
better go.
