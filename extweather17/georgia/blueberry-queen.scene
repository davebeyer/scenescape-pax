Ann is known as the Blueberry Queen in the small rural town of Alma,
Georgia, "Blueberry Capital of the State."  She and her husband
started growing blueberries on their 10-acre farm in the early 1970's.
Besides helping run the farm, now 50 acres, Ann was a school teacher
in business accounting and law until retiring in 2013, and since has
followed her passion top open her store that sells "everything
blueberry," from soap and syrup to beef jerky and pepper jelly.  Ann
described the freeze of 2017 which resulted in devestating losses to
the Georgia blueberry and peach crop.
