      We visit the places, from Montana to Texas, California to Puerto
      Rico, hit hard by the extreme weather of 2017, to share the
      experiences of and long-lasting effects on those affected.

    <introduction>

      <p>
        <b class="big">2017 raised the bar</b> for the breadth and
        intensity of extreme weather events in America with
        hurricanes, fires, tornadoes, droughts, floods, freezes and
        other weather events causing more damage than ever before.
        Americans experienced 16 occurrences of extreme weather, each
        costing more than 1 billion inflation-adjusted dollars, tying
        the record number set in 2011.  Historically, the annual average
        from 1980–2017 is 6 such events; however, this average
        has doubled to 11.6 over the past 5 years.
        Even more notable is the total
        cuumulative cost of the extreme weather of 2017 which incurred damages
        of over $300 billion dollars, shattering the former 2005
        record of by over 40%.  To put that into perspective, 
        $300 billion dollars is about twice what the federal
        government spends on veteran benefits, education,
        transportation, and environmental protection, combined.

        <b class="big">We may recall</b> watching the news reports on “Maria” and
        “Harvey” and perhaps a couple others, but for many of us,
        attention very soon moves on and returns to the latest
        political drama or Netflix series binge. However, for those
        affected, moving on isn’t so easy, which leads us to the next
        chapter of PAX, The Train’s Comin’. In this chapter, we travel
        around the country to meet the people directly, and harshly
        affected by many of these 16 extreme weather events to learn
        and share what it’s like to experience and attempt to “move
        on” from them as they become more common across the country.

        along the road to
        a new chapter in Portrait of America at the Crossroads as we
        document our travel across the country, and then in the
        coming months as we publish the stories of the people we’ve
        met.
