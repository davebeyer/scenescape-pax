A 7-year resident of Jacksonville, Shawn has been a manager at the
Pizza Hut on San Marco Boulevard for the past 4 years.  The Pizza Hut
is a couple blocks from St. Johns River which flooded many feet over
its banks during Hurriaine Irma.  He was at his store until the day of
the storm serving free pizza to the police and emergency services
preparing for the storm.
