We spoke with Wade in his solar-heated home that he built on his ranch
about 20 miles South of Baker, in South-East Montana.  Wade talked
about the effect of the Montana drought on his farm, which resulted in
a "total failure" for their Spring wheat harvest.  Wade also spoke
about the alarming increase in extreme weather (tornadoes, hail) in
his region, and the distressting long-term impact on the nation's food
supply.
