We met Vicki on her 5000-acre ranch in the small western Montana town
of Bynum.  Aggravating the hardships caused by the extreme drought
throughout Eastern Montana, the West has also been hit with an
extremely snowy and cold Winter and Spring, resulting in heavy losses
to cattle and endangering the viability of ranches throughout the
region.
