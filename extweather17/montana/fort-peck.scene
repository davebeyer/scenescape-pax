Tony's family lives in the same house that his Great Grandpa built
when he homesteaded the farm on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in
1916.  The Montana extreme drought and fires of 2017 have been rough
on the farms and ranches of his family and friends.  Two or three
similar years would likely lead to a lot of the farms going up for
sale, depending on how well they got along with their bankers.
