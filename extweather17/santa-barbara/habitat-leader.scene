Liz was working at a non-profit in San Francisco until the week of the
huge "Thomas" fire when she decided to return to her home town of
Santa Barbara to help with the recovery and restoration efforts.  She
arrived home just before the powerful and tragic mudslides in
neighboring Montecito, so her attention switched to that and the
challenges of leading disaster crews for Habitat for Humanity.
