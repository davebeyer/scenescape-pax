Marco, a long time resident of Montecito is also a local real estate
agent and is closely connected with local residents. He pays close
attention to local weather patterns, conditions, and their affect on
the landscape. He explains the formula of weather patterns that led to
the Thomas fire and then in January, after heavy rains, the subsequent
debris flows that decimated the town of Montecito.
