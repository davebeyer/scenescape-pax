It's the smallest things... the fire fighters wanted access to a restroom

Patrick has lived in Montecito most of his life, growing up in his
fathers deli, "Village Cheese and Wine."  He watched the Thomas fire,
largest in California history through 2017, grow from a flicker to an
entire mountain. Approximately three weeks after the Thomas fire,
approximately half an inch of rain in fifteen minutes fell on the
burned and glazed over Santa Ynez mountains above Santa Barbara and
the village of Montecito, causing mud and boulders to flow down creeks
and valleys into the village. Patrick opened up his deli to provide
food and facilities for the first responders and community in general.
