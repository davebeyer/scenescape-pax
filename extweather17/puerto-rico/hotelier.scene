Maria wasn't what we thought it would be
    </title>

    <description>
Janice was in Humacao, Puerto Rico when Hurricane Maria hit.  She was
trapped there with no way to communicate or reach her family or anyone
else in her home town of Yabuccoa, normally a 15-minute drive away.
After finding her way back two days later, she reunited first with her
grandparents, with a mixture of emotions, from great relief to
overwhelming sadness at what had become of her town.
