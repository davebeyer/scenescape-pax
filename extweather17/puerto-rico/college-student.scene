We met Natasha, a micro-biology student at University of Puerto Rico,
in the central mountain region of Utuado.  With available plywood becoming
scarce before the storm, Natasha's family boarded their windows with
layers of cardboard, and spent much of the storm soaking up rain water
that found its way into the house through the cracks around windows
and doors under the pressure of the winds.
