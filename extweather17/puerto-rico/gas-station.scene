We met Hector up in the mountains of central Puerto Rico.  
He had lived in Key West Florida for 17 years, but moved to Puerto Rico to
live with his mom (a native Puerto Rican "Ta√≠na") to avoid
Hurricane Irma as it approached Florida.  Unfortunately, a week later,
Puerto Rico was hit with its worst Hurricane in recorded history,
Maria.
