We met Yeradmel on the job at the grocery store in downtown Manuabo,
Puerto Rico.  Yeradmel rode out hurricane Maria with his mother in
their bathroom at the center of their house.  When Yeradmel realized
that the sudden calm of the storm was due to being in the eye, and
thus only temporary, his dejected, resignation was palpable.
