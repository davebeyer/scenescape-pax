With its backup generator, Danny was able to open his Super Market in
Manuabo within a week after Maria.  As the only open store for miles
around, he sold out everything within a few days, and it took another
two weeks to restock.  Danny was also trusted to bring stacks of
paychecks of the town residents on a regular trek to the nearby town
of Yabucoa while the roads were closed to get them cashed so they
could pay for supplies during the weeks following the hurricane.
