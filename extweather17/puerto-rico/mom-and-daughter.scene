We met Kitty and her daugher in a mountain town of central Puerto
Rico.  They recall Hurricane Maria lasting about 8 hours.  When we
asked them what they did to pass the time when they weren't minding
the windows and doors, such as play any games, Kitty was incredulous:
"Play games!?  Nooo, we prayed to God!"
