They scooped the rest of my house off the highway

A long-time resident of Perryville, Missouri, Patricia was in her house
when an EF4 tornado, one of a series of tornadoes to sweep through the
midwest February 28 through March 1, 2017, paid her a visit.  As
Patricia clung onto her couch in the basement, her son watched from
across the street as the tornado lifted and then exploded the house in
mid-air.  Although a substantial section of the house was thrown into
the street, none of the contents could be found in the area, not even
any piece of the washer, dryer, or fridge.
