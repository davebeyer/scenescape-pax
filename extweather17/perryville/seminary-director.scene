We spoke with Don, President of the Association of the
Miraculous Medal, in the pews of Saint Mary's Church in Perryville,
Missouri a year after a huge, EF4 tornado thundered through his town.
Beneath the floor of Saint Mary's rests the tomb of the Venerable
Felix de Andreis, one of the founders of the Catholic Seminary created
in 1818 at this site, the first such seminary west of the Mississippi
River.  Don relayed the story of how, upon his death, Felix de
Andreis blessed the residents of Perryville to protect them from
mortal harm from tornadoes.
