Tyson and his family live within view of Interstate 55 in Perryville,
Missouri.  On the side he runs an automotive restoration business and
had 40 to 50 cars and trucks on his property when an EF4 tornado
ripped through his neighborhood on the 28th of Februrary, 2017.  The
180 mile-per-hour winds tossed many of the cars down onto the
interstate, initially causing a huge emergency response until they
realized that most of the cars were empty (although sadly, one person
was killed).
