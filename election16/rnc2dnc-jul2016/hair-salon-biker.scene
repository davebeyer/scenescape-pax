      Ralph owns a hair salon in Trooper, Pennsylvania.  We met him at
      the Flight 93 Memorial outside Shanksville where he and his
      wife, along with some friends, had ridden their motorcycles up for a visit
      to see what the passengers went through on 9/11.  Ralph said he'd like
      to see Trump win, though isn't real confident about either one.
