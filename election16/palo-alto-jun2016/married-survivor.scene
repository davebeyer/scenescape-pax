    <title>9/11 is our Anniversary</title>
    <description>
       John met his partner 18
       years ago on September 11 (a few years before the attack).
       Initially reluctant to marry due to his Catholic
       upbringing, a scare with an HIV-related illness, and the fact
       that his partner couldn't make decisions for him while he was
       in a coma, changed his mind.  They've now been married for nearly 3
       years.
