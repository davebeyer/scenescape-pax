    <title>I was a gay, Latino, Republican</title>
    <description>
       John Sanchez, originally from Los Angeles, now lives in
       Oakland.  
       In college business school, John was a
       trickle-down-theory Republican, but his loss of many friends
       to AIDS and dismay at his Party's initial failure to 
       address AIDS as a crisis, caused him to switch.
