      People in big and small towns around the country, and attendees
      and activists at political rallies and conventions, share their
      concerns, priorities, and feelings leading up to the US election
      of 2016.
    </description>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        <b class="big">Ask anyone</b> 
        who has lived through the American presidential elections of the past 60
        years and they will tell you that there is no
        precedent for what took place during the lead up to the
        election of 2016, persists into the midterm election of 2018, 
        and by all indications, will continue into 2020, at least.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b class="big">Polarization,</b> real or perceived, of Democrat
        vs. Republican, liberal vs. conservative, privileged vs. the
        disempowered, consumes virtually every political dialogue
        to an extent rarely seen.  Many express
        feelings of frustration of being snubbed, left behind, and without a
        voice.  Politicians and the media have cashed in by cultivating
        the seeds of misinformation, conspiracy suspicions, 
        and fear, inevitably
        leading to exaggerated or irrational anger and vilification among voters, and
        to representatives incapable of compromise and governing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this chapter, <b class="big">PAX hopes to build bridges of understanding,
        </b> however slight,
        between the edges of these chasms, with an eye and ear toward
        the social and cultural rail of contemporary America.  
        PAX will attempt to probe beyond the looping rhetoric to
        seek unique and original stories and perspectives,
        as well as those commonly held hopes and values that reflect the
        passionate patriotism embraced by all sides.  Although the power-
        and financially-driven interests that benefit are constantly at work
        digging these chasms of division deeper, 
        we believe that
        the rims are not always inherently as far apart as these interests would 
        want us to think.
      </p>

        <b class="big">We invite</b> you to click on the stories below to hear the unique 
        perspectives of Americans leading up to the election of 2016, and

      </p>

      <p>
        <b class="big">Most importantly,</b> we hope to serve as a reminder of
        the critical importance to vote.  If "Stayed at Home" was a
        candidate, he or she would have won the election of 2016 by a
        landslide.  Unless you're really convinced that other people's futures are
        more important than yours, <b class="big">VOTE!</b>
