    <title> 
      Not spirtually ready for a woman president
    </title>

    <description>
      We met this lady with her mom (who was surprised to
      learn about some of her daughter's views!) in Los Gatos,
      California.  She had a collection of
      concerns from across the spectrum, including anxieties about a
      woman president versus one who's ill-suited &amp; ill-prepared,
      and our need to be more inclusive while also better securing our
      country.  Her reaction?  Financially hunker down.
